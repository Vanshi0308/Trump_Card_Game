# Trump Card Game

#### By Vanshika Sinha

## Introduction

This project aims to present a “Trump Card” game which demonstrates a type of Virtual Wrestling Entertainment using Augmented Reality, which uses professional wrestling characters from companies such as WWE, AEW and ROH. The game blends aspects of trading card games and augmented reality technologies to provide an immersive and engaging gaming experience.

## Implementation

The game utilizes a set of 4 cards that represent wrestlers, each with their unique attributes and special moves. The various attributes of the competing wrestlers are compared one after the another, including the rating, strength and years of experience of the respective wrestler, and the player associated with the wrestler having the higher value of these attributes wins the game. Each character in the game is represented with the help of an object. As a result, there are 4 objects representing the wrestlers, there is one object to represent the ring, for the wrestler objects to interact and there is also a referee object to add authenticity to the game, which can be used as a prompt to display results or other features.

## Resources and Software Tools Used

- Meshroom: For developing model objects of characters and other in-game props
- Sketchfab: For developing the basic proof-of-concept of the game in further iterations of development
- Samsung 3D Scanner: For generating a few representative samples
